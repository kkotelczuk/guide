Expo is a free and open source toolchain built around React Native to help you build native iOS and Android projects using JavaScript and React.

### Getting started

First, install expo-cli:

```bash 
npm install expo-cli --global 
```

Before you can start working with expo you have to sign in into your account, then create your first project:

```bash
expo init my-new-project
cd my-new-project
expo start
```

Now you can develop your app in a simulator or on your device. For this second option, you have to download a dedicated app and scan QR code from a terminal to run it inside expo client.

### Summary

Expo allows you easy start React Native app, then you have quick builds, hot reloading, easy use of components like push notifications, camera, icons etc.

Unfortunately, the expo has also dark sides. It's free so you haven't support immediately. If you want to eject it in order to add a custom component you getting into trouble. 

So it's best to use Expo for simple easy projects or learn React Native.
